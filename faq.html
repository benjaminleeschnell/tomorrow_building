        <h3>Have a few questions about living here? We thought you would! See the most common questions and our responses below.</h3>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <p><span class="red">How many units are there?</span><br>39 (33 studios, 6 one-bedrooms)</p>
          <p><span class="red">How big are the apartments?</span><br>The average size of the units are 350 square feet, but with 15 foot ceilings and floor to ceiling windows, the rooms will feel very spacious.</p>
          <p><span class="red">Will I have a roommate?</span><br>No way! We're creating the next generation of co-living. What that means for you is a private bathroom and kitchenette, and the ability to retreat to the comfort of your own, private space.</p>
          <p><span class="red">Are the units furnished?</span><br>All of the units are fully-furnished with a bed, built-in bed storage , one wardrove, one night stand (the furniture kind), one comfortable chair or sofa, one desk/dining table, two desk / dining chairs, one laptop table, a small refrigerator, and a stove with two burners. If you want to show up with just a backpack, great! And if you have a few more worldly possessions, you can, by all means, accommodate some odds and ends.</p>
          <p><span class="red">There's an applications process?</span><br>Yes, there is! We're on a mission to bring like-minded starters from diverse backgrounds together in a livin environment where they can thrive. We're being intentional by creating an application process that helps us better create that culture. But don't be afraid, our screening process is super approachable and easy. (We've had applicants interview remotely in their pajamas... just saying!)</p>
          <p><span class="red">Am I too old for this?</span><br>Of course not! We're open to anyone living at the Tomorrow Building if the environment works for them. That said, some of the basic features of the building naturally appeal to younger people with no kids who are looking for a more communal way of living.</p>
          <p><span class="red">How long can I stay?</span><br>We want to make your move to Chattanooga and/or the Tomorrow Building as seamless and flexible as possible. That's why we're offering leasing options for 3, 6, and 12-months. Beyond that, stay as long as you wish!</p>
          <p><span class="red">What's included in the rent?</span><br>Rent includes all utilities, 1GB of internet per unit, regular events and special programming, bicycle storage... on top of 38 of the most kick-ass neighbors in town!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <p><span class="red">Is parking included?</span><br>We're afraid not, though we'll be able to help you arrange a space nearby at an additional monthly cost. That said, the Tomorrow Building is located smack-dab in the middle of the city and one of the biggest perks of living here is location, location, location-- you'll seldom require a car. There's a free shuttle that can get you around downtown, access to Uber, and public buses/transportation available.</p>
          <p><span class="red">Are the units furnished?</span><br>All of the units are fully-furnished with a bed, built-in bed storage , one wardrove, one night stand (the furniture kind), one comfortable chair or sofa, one desk/dining table, two desk / dining chairs, one laptop table, a small refrigerator, and a stove with two burners. If you want to show up with just a backpack, great! And if you have a few more worldly possessions, you can, by all means, accommodate some odds and ends.</p>
          <p><span class="red">What about laundry?</span><br>There will be a laundry room with several washing machines and dryers on the fourth floor. These will be coin/card operated.</p>
          <p><span class="red">How will I keep my place clean?</span><br>We get it, you're busy! Fret not-- We'll take care of the communal spaces, and can point you to individual room cleaning services if you're interested.</p>
          <p><span class="red">Is there a gym in the building?</span><br>There's not, but you'll be a stone's throw away from several gyms, yoga studios, and soon-to-be remodeled Miller Park, Plaza, and Patten Parkway.</p>
          <p><span class="red">39 of us under one roof? Won't it get loud?</span><br>We thought it might, which is why we've chosen some of the highest-standard sound proofing around when renovating the building, not to mention that residents are spread out acros 3 floors in the building.</p>
          <p><span class="red">Yeah, but is there anything to do in Chattanooga?</span><br>Lover of the outdoors? We have on e of the most sought out outdoor scenes in the country. Bar-hop fanatic? The downtown area has seen a significant increase in restaurants and bars to serve its growing population with a continued rise in developments ofr more to come! Music junkie? We have a growing locla music scene, a popular multi-day music festival with top acts each year, and a summer long concert series right downtown! Need I say more? You'll have trouble keeping a free schedule!</p>
